<p>Hi, I'm an inquisitive change-maker whose passionate about creating meaningful change through computer science. I'm a technology enthusiast inspired by cutting-edge research that will forever shape our tomorrow. I'm also excited about technology, such as Edge Computing, Data Management, and Network security. In the future, I want to work with Artificial intelligence (AI) and “Big” Data to solve “Big” problems in today’s world. I want to bring people closer to technology and show them how technology can create change where least expected.</p1>
