Weekly Description
Data science is one of today’s most in-demand functions — and it involves human construction of models to make sense of data. Mastering the ability to analyze and visualize data in meaningful ways using Python is a critical step in your eventual study of machine learning and artificial intelligence, which automate the process of pattern discovery and statistical modeling of data. 

This week, you'll start by exploring Python as a programming language and as an ecosystem of packages that support various kinds of data analyses and data visualizations. You will review and practice key features of Python that will allow you to build data analysis pipelines, and you will learn how to combine the built-in functionality of Python along with custom code to unleash the power of your data analysis pipeline.
