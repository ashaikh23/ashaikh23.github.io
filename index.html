          <p>When I thought about a simple concept or a complex invention, I could always see myself using my idea in my daily life. However, I wanted to bring my imagination to reality. Welcome to the world of 3D Modeling. In this digital realm, I'm able to take my crazy breakthroughs and visualizing them through a 3D scale. Then, through the power of 3D printing, I'm able to push the digital to the physical. </p>
